Solid-Fluid Interaction
	Displacement of fluid
	Coating of solid
	Momentum transfer
	Heat transfer
	Breakapart/Splashing
	Chemical Interactions? Or does coating take care of this
	Coating Chemical interaction?
	
Fluid-Fluid interaction
	Coalescing/rejecting
	Heat transfer
	Chemical Interaction
	
Interactions:
	Endo/exothermic
	Energy production
	Conversion of reactants to products
	Gas production/pressure generation
